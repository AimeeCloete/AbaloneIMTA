# Project description
The high value abalone species, Haliotis midae, and the Cape sea urchin, Parechinus angulosus, have a similar preferred temperature range (12 – 20 °C) and commonly occur together in nature. Particularly during the juvenile stages of the abalone life cycle, the urchins provide the juvenile abalone with shelter and protection from predators (Day & Branch, 2002). 
Considering co-habitation of sea urchins and abalone in natural environments, as well as the potential symbiotic relationships that exist between them, they could be co-cultured as a method 
This project will include an assessment of animal growth and survival, throughout a 2 month experimental period of an already on-going large-scale co-habitation trial on Buffeljags abalone farm. 
Control group is fed a mixed diet of diatoms, Ulva, Graciliaria and Abfeed.
Treatment group has urchin faecal matter added to their mixed diet.
The control and treatment groups will be compared for significant differences in growth and survival to establish whether co-culturing sea urchins and abalone could be  improve abalone production through the trophic transfer of microbial communities.
